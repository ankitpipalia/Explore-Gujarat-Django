                administrative capital of the Gujarat located on the western bank of Sabarmati river. Named after the
                father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, Gandhinagar is the second planned city of India, after Chandigarh. The
                city is divided into thirty organised sectors, each of them is pedestrian friendly and self-contained.
                It's more of a people-oriented city, with all the parks, monuments, gardens and grand civic buildings.
                This spacious city also houses many places to visit for sightseeing like Swaminarayan Temple, Sarita
                Udyan, Children's Park, Indroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park, Rani Roopmatis Mosque and Capital Complex.
                Besides, there are many dishes that reflect the Gujarat's rich heritage. Gandhinagar is a
                vegetarian-friendly city. Although the capital city has many upscale restaurants, it's street food that
                represents the gastronomic vibe.</p>

                colors, and infinite variety, is the place where time has left its footprints. The literal meaning of
                term Kutch is something which intermittently becomes wet and dry. The term 'Kutch' is also used for
                tortoise in Sanskrit. A large part of the Kutch, commonly known as the Great Rann of Kutch, submerges in
                water during the rainy season and becomes dry during the winter season. Starting from Indus valley
                civilization to Rao dynasty, every ruler has gifted Kutch legacy of art and architecture.</p>

                City

                intriguing medieval charm. Historic romanticism, along with the coastal graciousness, is what makes
                Surat an important tourist destination in Gujarat.One can see the footprints of the city in the epic
                novel, Mahabharat, as per which Lord Krishna had a brief stopover in Surat when he was going to Dwarka,
                from Mathura. In 990 AD, Surat was known as Suryapur, meaning the city of the sun god. By the 12th
                century, Parsis began to settle in the city and prevailed with dignity in this region of Gujarat.</p>

                brainchild of Sayajirao III, a farsighted ruler who introduced free primary education and laid
                foundation for premier institutions like Bank of Baroda, a railway system and Maharaja Sayajirao
                University.Many tales and fables are associated with the name of the city. As per the history accounts,
                the city was christened as 'Chandravati' after its ruler Raja Chandan, later it was changed to 'Viravati
                'meaning the abode of the brave, and then 'Vadpatra' due to the abundance of banyan trees here. From the
                term 'Vadpatra', the city got its final name - Baroda or Vadodara.</p>

            <p class="city-text text-secondary">Bhavnagar is a tiny town that greets everybody with its richness of
                traditions, enlaced in the modern life. Due to its closeness to the sea, the city has always been an
                important centre of trade and commerce of cotton goods. Today this large provincial city has some
                intriguing temples, museums and also serves as a gateway to several parks and reserves including
                Velavadar Blackbuck National Park. The city has associations with Mahatma Gandhi, who went to university
                here, and relics of his life can be seen at Gandhi Smriti in the 1895 AD Barton museum building, which
                also has a collection of coins, stamps, guns and other arms, sculpture and folk arts. It is a bustling
                trading centre with colourfully set bazaars, people sporting blood-red turbans, puppet sellers, and
                festivals and fairs. Takhteshwar Temple, Gaurishankar Lake, Nilambagh, Velavadar National Park, Victoria
                Park, Khodiyar Mandir, Aksharwadi Temple, and Shri Adishwar Temple are some important tourist
                attractions, which are worth a visit on a holiday to Bhavnagar.</p>

                Known to the world as the Jewel of Kathiawar, Jamnagar is an offbeat tourist holiday destination in
                Gujarat brimming with the ornate building, pristine coastal region and picturesque lakes. Located on the
                coast of Gulf of Kutch, Jamnagar is the largest city on the western region of India. In the heart of the
                city, there is a fort amidst the lake while the coastal area is covered with an oil refinery, which is
                largest in the world, beaches and spectacular Marine National Park. With exquisite Rajput architecture
                and pristine coastline, Jamnagar is Gujarat's lesser-known gems.Jamnagar (former Nawanagar) came into
                limelight 444 years ago when it was established on the bank of Nagmatti and Rangmattiriver by the Shri
                Jam Raval, who is deemed as one of the heirs of Lord Krishna.</p>

                is a heady mix of marvellous architecture and vibrant street life. The literal meaning of the term
                "Junagadh" is "old city", the city takes its name from Uparkot, an ancient fort built in the 4th century
                CE on a plateau at the eastern edge of the town. Junagadh is also known as "Sorath", the name of the
                earlier Princely State of Junagadh. In Junagadh, one can see in inscriptions, edicts, caves, temples,
                forts, stepwells, tanks and canons dating back to 2nd century AD, and not to forget the Girnar
                Hill.Amongst the numerous attractions in Junagadh, places like Girnar, Mahabat Maqbara, Uperkot fort,
                Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Damodar Kund and Damodarji Temple, are most favourite of the tourists.
