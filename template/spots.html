                erstwhile home has been converted to a simple but engaging museum. The Ashram, named after the eponym
                Sabarmati River is fragmented into two sections – where Gandhi actually lived, and the modern section
                conceived by architect Charles Correa. The ashram is ensconced in a peaceful aura, partially due to the
                reverence that visitors show and possibly due to a unique energy that the place actually has. This is
                the place where Gandhi started the Satyagraha Movement. You will find that the complex dotted with
                people meditating, walking in silence or transfixed to the gallery, which showcases Gandhi’s many
                photographs and memorabilia. The finest part for a traveller is to pick a spinning wheel memento from
                the curio shop and also send a postcard from the in-house postbox. A special ‘charkha’ stamp is used
                when your mail leaves the ashram.</p>

                temple, the Dattatreya shrine, and many Hindu temples as well as several Jain temples.
                The project was first proposed by the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited (TCGL) in 1983 which
                suggested the diversion of about 9.1 hectares (22 acres) of forest land. The Government of Gujarat
                finalised diversion of 7.29 hectares (18.0 acres) of forest land in 1994 and the compensatory forest
                land was granted near Toraniya village. The Government of India also permitted in 1995.The project was
                delayed when the palanquin-bearers, who carried pilgrims up the mount, opposed the
                project and petitioned the Gujarat High Court regarding their livelihood. The petition was dismissed
                after the company constructing the ropeway, Usha Breco Limited, agreed for compensatory livelihood.[2]
                As of 2020, total 104 shops for palanquin-bearers who were affected by the project, are being
                constructed in the parking lot of the lower terminal.</p>

                the Kutch region of Gujarat is sometimes described as India's "Wild West". Its name, Kutch (or Kachchh),
                refers to the fact that it alternates between wet (submerged during the monsoon season) and dry. Much of
                Kutch consists of seasonal wetlands known as the Great Rann of Kutch (famous for its salt desert) and
                smaller Little Rann of Kutch (famous for its Wild Ass Sanctuary). Other attractions in the Kutch region
                include historic Bhuj, villages and traditional handicrafts, the ship building in the port town of
                Mandvi, and the Dholavira ruins of an ancient Indus Valley Civilization/Harappan city.</p>

                grown rapidly to serve the pilgrim trade around the Shatrunjaya Hill. The sacred site contains hundreds
                of shrines that were sanctified when Rishabha, the first Tirthankara of Jainism, gave his first sermon
                in the temple on the hilltop. Even though the climb to the temples is a rigorous one, it awards a
                dazzling sight of the intricately carved temples. During the Kartik Purnima festival, accommodation
                around town floods with pilgrims and is best booked in advance.The Palitana temples on Shatrunjaya Hill
                were built over a period of 900 years starting from the 11th century. It was Kumarpal Solanki, a great
                Jain patron, who built the first temples on this site. The temples were destroyed by Turkish Muslim
                invaders in 1311 AD, when the saint Jinaprabhasuri, who was then 50 years old, presided over the
                temples, but later restored them to their glory.</p>
